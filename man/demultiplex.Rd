\title{De-multiplexing fastq files}
\usage{
demultiplex(metadata.tbl, in.folder, out.folder, trim.primers = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{metadata.tbl}{Table with data for each sample, see Details below.}

\item{in.folder}{Name of folder where the raw fastq files are located.}

\item{out.folder}{Name of folder to output de-multiplexed fastq files.}

\item{trim.primers}{Logical indicating if PCR-primers should be trimmed from start of R1 and R2 reads.}

\item{compress.out}{Logical to indicate compressed output or not.}

\item{pattern}{The pattern to recognize the raw fastq files from other files}
}
\value{
The function will output the de-multiplexed fastq-files to the
\code{out.folder}. The name of each file consists of the corresponding
ProjectID_SequencingRunID_SampleID, with the extensions \code{_R1.fastq.gz}
or \code{_R2.fastq.gz}.

The function will return the \code{metadata.tbl} where the columns \code{filename}
and \code{filename2} have been filled with the names of the demultiplexed
fastq files, the R1 and R2 file respectively.

\description{
De-multiplexing Illumina data based on the extra forward barcode
used by MiDiv lab.
}
\details{
The input \code{metadata.tbl} must be a table (tibble or data.frame)
with one row for each sample. It must follow the MiDiv metadata table standard
format. The columns used by this function are:
* ProjectID
* SequencingRunID
* SampleID
* Rawfile_R1
* Rawfile_R2
* Barcode
* Forward_primer
* Reverse_primer
* filename
* filename2

The ProjectID, SequencingRunID and SampleID should all be a short text
(SampleID may be just an integer). The names of the de-multiplexed fastq files will
follow the format: ProjectID_SequencingRunID_SampleID_Rx.fastq.gz, where x is 1 or 2,
so avoid using symbols not recommended in file names (e.g. space, slash).

De-multiplexing means extracting subsets of reads from raw fastq files, those
named in columns Rawfile_R1 and Rawfile_R2 (if single-end reads, only Rawfile_R1).
The subset of read-pairs for each sample is identified by a barcode
sequence, and this must be listed in the Barcode column. The Barcode
sequence is matched at the start of the R1-reads only.

If \code{trim.primers=TRUE} the start of the R1 sequence is trimmed by the
length of Forward_primer, and the start of the R2 read trimmed by the length
of Reverse_primer. NOTE: There is no primer-matching here. No reads are discarded,
only trimmed by primer lengths.

The files listed in Rawfile_R1 and Rawfile_R2 must all be in the \code{in.folder}.
These files may be compressed (.gz).
